; use your new customized file.
; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more

 dispatching Workers, Migrants, Settlers, Engineers, or a Transport with the \"clean pollution\"\
 order. Pollution from production is likely to start becoming important as your civilization\
 becomes more industrialized, giving you buildings such as Factory and Power Plant which\
 boost production. Replacing a Power Plant with cleaner forms of energy --\
 a Hydro Plant / Hoover Dam, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant -- will reduce pollution from\
 production, as will a Recycling Center. The city's population starts adding to pollution\
 with the Factory, Super Highways, Offshore Platform, and Mfg. Plant buildings; each building\
 causes the population to add more to pollution. A Mass Transit will counteract the pollution\
 from two buildings in a city, and the Eiffel Tower wonder will counteract the pollution from\
 one building in all the owner's cities. The contribution of these factors can be seen in the\
 city dialog; once it exceeds a threshold, the excess is the percent chance of pollution appearing\
 each turn. When an unused tile becomes polluted, there is the temptation to avoid the effort of\
 cleaning it; but the spread of pollution has far more terrible results than the immediate economic\
 impact -- every polluted tile increases the chance of global warming. Each time global warming\
 advances, the entire world loses coastal land to the sea and to jungles and swamps, and inland\
 tiles are lost to desert. This tends to devastate cities and leads to global impoverishment. The\
 risk of global warming is cumulative; the longer polluted tiles are left uncleaned, the higher\
 the risk becomes, and the risk can linger for some time even after all pollution has been\
 cleaned. If a long time passes with an elevated risk of warming, its effects will be all the\
 more severe when it does occur.")
