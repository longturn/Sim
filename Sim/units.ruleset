Without knowledge of Electricity, this requires a nearby source of water: an ocean, lake, or river tile, or another tile with an irrigation system, must share an edge (not just a corner) with the target tile. Once Electricity is known, irrigation systems may be built without a water source. Once irrigated, land remains so even if the water source is removed. When Refrigeration is known, irrigation systems can be upgraded to Farmland by irrigating them a second time; this provides more food to a city if it has a Supermarket.","Building a mine on suitable terrain increases the \number of production points produced by that tile. However, it is not possible to have an irrigation system and a mine on the same tile.","On terrain unsuitable for irrigation systems or mines, issuing the \\\"irrigate\" or \"mine\" order may permanently convert the terrain to another type; this is usually more expensive. For instance, Forest may be \"irrigated\" to yield Plains. (Terrain conversion with the \"irrigate\" order does not require a water source.)","Workers can build airbases and buoys, which Settlers and Migrants cannot.

By paying a sum of gold the unit will immediately become yours; the exact sum depends on the status of the unit and that of the civilization owning it. However, units belonging to Republican or Democratic governments cannot be bribed. Bribery when not at war will cause a diplomatic incident.","Diplomats can also perform a number of actions in another player's city, although each Diplomat may attempt only one action. Most of these actions have a chance of failure. Also, any enemy Diplomats or Spies in the city will oppose hostile actions; in this case, either your unit or the defending unit will die.

Each player you have an embassy with that knows a technology reduces that technology's research cost to you."," - \"Investigate City\": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing."," - \"Sabotage City\": Your unit attempts either to disrupt all the city's work so far towards its current project, or to destroy an existing building in the city, at random. Once built, Palaces and Wonders cannot be sabotaged, and attempts to sabotage City Walls or any building in a capital each halve the chance of success. Sabotage may only be attempted when openly at war."," - \"Steal Technology\": Your unit attempts to learn the secrets of a random technology known to the city's owner but not to you. Technology may only be stolen once from a given enemy city by Diplomats. This action may be attempted even when not at war, but will cause a diplomatic incident."," - \"Incite a Revolt\": In return for gold a foreign city will change allegiance and join your empire, bringing along all nearby units that call it home, but reducing its size by 1. Units in other cities remain in the enemy's control, but units outside cities are lost to both players. The exact sum depends on the status of the city and that of the civilization that owns it. It is not possible to incite a rebellion in a capital, or in any city governed by a Federation or Democracy. Incitement may be attempted in peacetime, but will cause a diplomatic incident.","In some game strategies, hordes of Diplomats can be used to wreak havoc on the enemy.
